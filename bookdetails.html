    <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>

    <p>The Great Gatsby is a novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New
        York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with Jay Gatsby, the mysterious
        millionaire with an obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.
    
        The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he
        attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough
        draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work
        over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent
        about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art, named Celestial
        Eyes, greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel</p>
